Data Visualization with Python using  Matplotlib and Seaborne
You can find the data visualisation tutorials here [https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/data-visualization-with-python]

End of Week Project:

A dataset from kaggle will be used and we’ll be doing some visualization on the data.

## Week 4

We’ll be working on a dataset as a project which will cover all we’ve done so far  

Project detail:  A more complex dataset will be used where we will be analyzing and visualizing the data then try to make sense out of the raw data given.
